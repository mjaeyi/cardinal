When creating a new patient, a new directory should be created for said patient under
"/data/oci/USERID"
"/data/oci/USERID/archive"
*****DONE*****


There should be another field to hold directory path. (model)
*****DONE*****


Plot and Score path should initially be left blank. (views - new patient page)
*****DONE*****


Plot and Score hyperlinks should only be made if a plot and score field exists. (views - show patient page)
*****DONE*****


A button to generate the plots and score (if there is microarray data). (views - show patient page)
*****DONE*****
  The button will extract patient data for ca125, surg, drugs and create a USERID.txt file in patient directory. (controller)

  A script will process the USERID.txt file and format to USERID.pd file. (controller)

  A script to generate the plot using the USERID.pd to USERID_plot.pdf (controller)
  *****DONE*****

  Plot field will now hold path to the USERID_plot.pdf (controller)
     If USERID_plot.pdf already exists... overwrite or send to archive as timestamped? (controller)
     Overwrite USERID.txt and USERID.pd
     *****DONE*****

       However... if many generates get called then archive folder will grow large... keep the 5 most recent?

When deleting a patient, what should we do to the created directory files. (controller)
  Archive or delete it?
